<h1>CyberMSI DevOps Private GitHub Repo</h1>

This is the private GitHub repo for Cyber Managed Services Inc. This repo contains the files needed to run Azure DevOps automations for deploying specific Sentinel features.
Any additions or edits to the code in this repository should only be done after receiving approval from a team lead. The reason for this restriction is to reduce the chances
of unintended consequences as a result of the CI/CD integrations that are dependent on this repo. In addition to the permissions any controbutions to the repo should have
comments that describe what the addition is used for unless the file is a JSON file. Comments make the code easier to understand and will help others fix any issues that 
may arise in the future.
